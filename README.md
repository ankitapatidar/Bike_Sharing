# Bike_Sharing

The dataset consists of hourly bike rental data for two years. The train dataset is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, 
while the test dataset has the data from 20th till end of each month. 

In this project we attempted to predict the number of bike rentals using various attributes like datetime, season, holiday, 
working day, weather, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed, casual, registered and count(dependent variable).

We have used Regularized Linear Regression Model and an Ensemble Model(Random Forest) for the predictions.
